# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview: The purpose of this challenge was to find out the exact number of employees that were retiring per title and find out which of the employees were eligible to participate in the mentorship program to teach new employees that have joined. An SQL database would be used and entity relationship diagrams would be used to create the different tables asked for in the challenge. 

## Results: There were a couple of results that were able to be found.
-From taking a look at the mentorship eligibility file, it could be determined that there are 1,549 employees that could train others.
-The mentor to mentee ratio would be at an average of 1:59.
-The majority of the people retiring are from the development department, production sales, and customer service.
-From taking a look at the unique titles file, it could be determined that there are 90,398 employees retiring. 
-It could be seen that there are 20% more male employees than female. The company could hire more females the next time around to lessen the gender gap. 

## Summary: 
-How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
There are a little more than 90,000 employees that are going to retire soon. The amount of positions that will need to be replaced directly depends on how many people actually retire. 

-Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
Every single mentor has on average 59 mentees and people that they are training. This might be different depending on which departments need more attention and need more employee training. Since the most employees are leaving from the development department, production sales department, and customer service departments, it could be said that the most mentors will probably be needed to train the new employees in those departments. 

Another query that could provide more information, could be to use current employees whose birthdays are not in 1965 to be eligible to be a mentor. This would really help the company get higher engagement from their employees as well as more retention from them as well. Another table that could be made could be one that looks at the employees salaries. There could also be some bar charts that capture the average salaries by the job title.
